# Motion Aftereffect Illusion Demo

This project is an interactive demonstration of the **motion aftereffect** (also known as the waterfall illusion), where prolonged exposure to a moving visual pattern causes a stationary image to appear as if it is drifting in the opposite direction. The demo lets users customize the illusion parameters (pattern type, speed, direction, and adaptation duration) and download their illusion-strength ratings as JSON data.

This is the Illusion II project for PSYCH 30N: Introduction to Perception by Anushka De.
